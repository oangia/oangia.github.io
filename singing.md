## I. Songwriter
1. Try to write good songs - this is the real work, hobby ... nothing happens without doing the work

Spend time don't do anything except writing, you can not write anything if you don't want to.

Bonus: Inspiration, love for music
Make it a habit, write as much as you want, get inspiration from observing life.

2. Learning songs from records (support): Pick a song and analyze what makes you feel good

## Singing
Strong = 1. Resonance + 2. Open throat + 3. Breath support + 4. Clearity (vowel shape)

Clear vowels: 1 "ng" => "y" + "ah ay ee oh oo"
Strength training: 1 / 3 / 5 / 8 / 5 / 3 / 1 "bah"

Find your strongest, clearest position with 5 vowels and practice consistency on scales.

## Songs
### Warm up
Cuộc tình trong cơn mưa

Biết tìm đâu

Lạ lùng

Đắp mộ cuộc tình

Gió
### Main songs
Ngày chưa giông bão

Con cò

Nàng thơ

Bèo dạt mây trôi

Tháng tư là lời nói dối của em

Trái tim bên lề

How deep is your love

Your song 

I don’t want to miss a thing
